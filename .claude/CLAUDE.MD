# Project Context

My friend, Grey, just created this script, @export_playlists.py, for exporting Spotify playlists following the vision outlined at @README.md.

Right now, the process to use this script is a bit technical. Grey would like to make it more accessible!

Check out @docs/toward-accessibility/initial-thoughts-from-col.md to see where we're starting.
