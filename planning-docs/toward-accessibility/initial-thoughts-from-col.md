# Toward Accessibility

How can we make Grey's Spotify playlist export tool more accessible to non-technical peeps?

Let's explore by...

1. Reviewing the process outlined in @README.md and review the code structure in @export_playlists.py
2. Exhaustively listing possibilities for packaging this functionality in a non-technical user-friendly manner (i.e., a webpage (mobile and desktop accessible), mobile apps for android and ios, etc.)
3. Create concise, rough sketches of what each possibility would entail 
4. Discerning the avenue that balances feasibility with user friendlyness

The goal of this development effort is not to create a more complex application, but to package this fairly simple routine and script in an accessible, preferably minimalistic package!
